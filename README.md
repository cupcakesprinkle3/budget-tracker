# Budget Tracker

## Motivation
As part of the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, I have taken starter code for a budget tracker app and added a few compelling features: Added offline functionality and added mobile-friendly features. This will help users be able to enjoy the budget tracker app with or without a data/internet connection and on desktop and mobile, with a mobile experience of a native mobile app.

## Tech Used
Technology used includes: Express.js, IndexedDB, service workers, web manifest (manifest.json), MongoDB Atlas, and Heroku.
